title: Usage Ideas
---

Here we will have a collection of ideas for developers, for what they can build using Kryptokrona Kotlin SDK. We would love to have developers building it with our SDK in Kotlin!

## Mobile Wallet

This is the most obvious way of using Kryptokrona Kotlin SDK. Kotlin multiplatform allows for Android/iOS and of course many other platforms to build upon. Kryptokrona already has a wallet, but it would be very interesting to have different variations out there for people to choose on!

## Desktop Wallet

Since Kotlin multiplatform allows for development on all platforms, this can also be done in Kotlin to build a desktop wallet. Kotlin allows for building into binary form.

## Pool Backend

Since we are building a wrapper around Kryptokrona Service, this should be possible to build a backend with frameworks such as Spring or Ktor. Then apply a frontend framework of your choice to get this data from the pool backend.

## Hugin Mobile

We already have our official Hugin mobile application, but this doesn't mean it has to be just _one_, and can be alternative Hugin mobile applications out there for those who want to customize the experience. 

## Hugin Desktop

Same as with desktop wallet, we could build an alternative Hugin desktop client as well. Although many other technologies would need to be applied that cannot be provided through this SDK. 

## Machine Learning

Kotlin can be used for data science. Kotlin works with Jupyter notebooks. Read more [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-science-overview.html#kotlin-libraries) regarding which library to use (there are several ones). 

### Graph Analysis

Analyze the network structure of the Kryptokrona blockchain, such as identifying key nodes or subgraphs. This could help by highlighting scalability or security issues for preventive measures. 


*If you choose to build something, even if it's not complete, please showcase it here on our [Discussions](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-kotlin-sdk/discussions/20).*
