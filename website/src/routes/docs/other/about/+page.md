CryptoNote is a so-called “application layer” protocol further developed by <a href="https://docs.turtlecoin.lol/" target="_blank">**TurtleCoin**</a> that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

Kryptokrona Kotlin SDK was created by Marcus Cvjeticanin 2022 as an experimental project in Java, to learn more about the Kryptokrona network protocols.
It was later rewritten in Kotlin to enable more modern language features and an easier way for developers to start building simple application on top of the
Kryptokrona network.

Kryptokrona SDK for Kotlin is currently the most fully featured implementation of the Kryptokrona Network protocols and 
includes many useful libraries and tools for building decentralized private communication and payment systems.
