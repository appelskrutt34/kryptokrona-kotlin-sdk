title: Changelog Format
---

This is the suggested format for entries in [releases](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-kotlin-sdk/releases). The changelog is intended for our users and for developers outside of Kryptokrona organization. Please write the entries with that in mind. For example, "fixed that thing we talked about last week" is not great.

For each entry, include links to the relevant issue(s) at the end.
